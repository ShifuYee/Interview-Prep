You can perform the following operations on the string, `a`:

1. Capitalize 0 or more of `a`'s lowercase letters.
2. Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in `a`.

Given two strings, `a` and `b`, determine if it's possible to make `a` equal to `b` as described.

For example, given `a = AbcDE` and `b = ABDE`, in `a` we can capitalize 'b' and delete 'c' to match `b`. If `a = AbcDE` and `b = AFDE`, matching is not possible because letters may only be capitalized or discarded, not changed.
